# My Dcoder Solutions
## What?
I have been using [Dcoder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paprbit.dcoder&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=use_app&utm_campaign=use_app_campaign) for a while and also done some of the problems in Algo Yo. I make this repository to share my own solutions with the others. In any way, you should have done the problems by yourself before look into my solutions.

## Warning -
**I am a lazy guy.** So my solutions might be very short, simple, cheating, or unreadable. So, use it at your own risk.

## I have a better algorithm than you.
Great! feel free to send me pull requests
